; This program prints all ASCII characters between code 32 and 128.
; It's a variation of the first example presented in the MAXAM manual

.main               ; defines a label 'main', ABASM ignores the '.' symbol
    ld a,32         ; first ASCII code in accumulator

.loop               ; Defines a label 'loop'
    call &BB5A      ; CALL txt_output, the firmware output routine
    inc  a          ; move to next character
    cp   128        ; have we done them all?
    jr   c,loop     ; no - go back for another one

.end  
    jp   end        ; infinite loop used as the program's end point
