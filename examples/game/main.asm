; you fly through space. 

; Controls are left or right arrow keys.

; Collision Detection
; In order to test if the rocket ship has collided with a bolder
; I've written a routine which tests for a pixel. Test is a 
; Graphical routine though, so in order to use this, I've setup
; ex and ey which holds the graphical positions in front and 
; above the rocket. ex had 12 added to it to allow the test to 
; return a non-zero result. When moving left or right with the 
; cursor keys ex is updated by either subtracting 32 or adding 
; 32.

; Gen Seed routine

.genseed

	ld (seed),a

; 8bit Random Number generator
; It takes a value stored in seed and returns a new number which gets 
; stored back into seed. In order make the routine a bit more random
; the Gen Seed routine is used to obtain a random value from the 
; refresh register (r).

; Setinks
; Entry Conditions:
;      hl = colours
; This just sets up a colour palette using a loop to increment through
; the PEN colours, c obtains the contents of hl which is the ink and is
; passed to b to prevent inks flashing. af & hl are pushed onto the stack
; because the SCR SET INK firmware alters these registers and pop restores
; them. When all 15 pens have been done, 'a' register is incremented if 
; this equals 16 then a jr c will not jump as there is no carry.

.setinks
	ld c,(hl)
	ld b,c
	push af

; Scroll Routine
; a = 0 to return a black background
; b = 0 to roll the screen top to bottom
; to make this game a little bit more challenging, I'm using SCR HW ROLL
; which rolls the screen very quickly. 
; To space out the bolders, I've called this routine twice, which has 
; produced this intense game, but it's always going to produce quite a 
; bit of flicker.

; Scale number routine
; This takes the number produced by the random number generator which is
